                <p>Living with a nickel allergy can be overwhelming. After all, nickel is one of the most common elements on earth. If your allergy is severe enough to be triggered by nickel in foods, you're in the right place. The Low-Nickel Diet Tracker has your back.</p>
                <p>Rather than guess what is safe for you to eat based on vague, incomplete 'eat this not that' lists, this tracker relies on a points system developed by Mona Mislanker, BS and Matthew J. Zirwas, MD. Each food is assigned a points value based on how much nickel it usually contains. Use the tracker to stay below 15 points per day. Simply log your food as you eat throughout the day, and you'll know exactly where you stand and how to plan your meals.</p>
                <p>Following a low-nickel diet is easy with the Low-Nickel Diet Tracker.</p>
